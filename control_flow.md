# Control Flow
  Control Flow refers to the use of comparison logic to determine what to do next. By that, I mean using if, elif, else statements to filter what code to run based on
  certain conditions. 

@[The test cases provided test some of the common "corner cases" you may want to test.]({"stubs": ["py_files/control_flow_1.py"], "command": "python3 py_files/control_flow_1.py"})

If and elif statements will execute if the expression equates to True or 1. If the expression evaluates down to any other value, the attached code won't execute. 
    
@[Here are some examples of such:]({"stubs": ["py_files/control_flow_2.py"], "command": "python3 py_files/control_flow_2.py"})

You can also chain conditions in your if, elif, else statement blocks. This can be done with and, or, not, and xor.
