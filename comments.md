# Comments
   
   Comments are very useful in programming. If you're coding for work or to be published, you'll want to explain your code with comments. You can also use
   comments in debugging to investigate your code further.  
    
    # This is a single line comment. Any line that starts with a # will be seen as a comment by the compiler / interpreter / computer. 
    
    '''
    This
    is
    a
    multi
    line
    comment
    '''

    """
    This
    is
    also
    a 
    multi
    line
    comment
    """
    
    # It gets a weird value here, still not sure why?

# Disabling parts of your code

Sometimes, you just want a part of your code to stop temporarily. I often find myself doing this when trying to optimize my code or when trying to single
out a corner case in my code. 

Let's take that mass of code from the previous page and try looking at each piece individually.
