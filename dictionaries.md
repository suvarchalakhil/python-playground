# Hands-on Demo
 
Write a Python script to concatenate the following dictionaries to create a new one.

Example 1:
 
Input: 
```python
dic1 = {1: 10, 2: 20}
dic2 = {3: 30, 4: 40}
```
  Output : ```{1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40}```

Example 2:
 
Input: 
```python
dic1 = {1: 10, 2: 20}
dic2 = {3: 30, 4: 40}
dic3 = {5: 50, 6: 60}
```
  Output : ```{1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}```

# Exercise 1
 
  Write a Python script to concatenate the following dictionaries to create a new one.
    

    Sample Data: 
```python
dic1 = {1: 10, 2: 20}
dic2 = {3: 30, 4: 40}
dic3 = {5: 50, 6: 60}
dic4 = {}
print(dic4)
```
  Expected Result : ```{1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}```

# Exercise 2
 
  Write a Python program to check whether a given key already exists in a dictionary.
    Sample Data: 

    key = 5

    d = {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}
    ```
  Expected Output : True

# Exercise 3
 
  Write a Python script to generate and print a dictionary that contains a number (between 1 and n) in the form (x, x*x).
 
    
    Sample Data: 

    n = 5
    
  Expected Output : {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
