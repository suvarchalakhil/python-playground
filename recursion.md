# Recursion

To demonstrate recursion, we need to define a function. The concept is where we have a function that calls itself until a condition is met. It's also easy to 
write infinite loops with recursion. The condition needing to be met is known as the Base Case. Once we reach that Base Case, we return all the data we've 
calculated.
